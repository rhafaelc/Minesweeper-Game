## Introduction

This Minesweeper game is a browser-based implementation of the classic puzzle game where players uncover tiles on a grid, trying to avoid mines. The objective is to reveal all the tiles that do not contain mines.

## Features

- 10x10 game board with 10 mines.
- Left-click to reveal a tile.
- Right-click to mark a tile as a mine.
- Dynamic display of the number of mines left.
- Win and lose messages.

## How to Play

1. **Reveal Tiles:** Left-click on a tile to reveal it. If it contains a mine, you lose. If not, it will show the number of adjacent mines.
2. **Mark Mines:** Right-click on a tile to mark it as a mine. This helps you keep track of where you think mines are located.
3. **Win the Game:** Reveal all the tiles that do not contain mines to win the game. If you mark all mines correctly, you win!
